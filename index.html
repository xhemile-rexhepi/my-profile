			<h2>I am Xhemile :)</h2>
				<p>
					My nickname is Milka and I'm 22 years old. I am currently living in Cergy, France to study at the ESSEC Business School. However, I was born and raised in Germany but my parents are originally from Albania. I've always been interested in web development, but I never got around to learning it. The "Web Development" course from Le Wagon came in very handy. I really enjoy it and I can let my creativity run free while developing the website. 
				</p>
				<p>I really love cooking and fashion. Furthermore I love my dog Ari.</p>
				<p>If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me!</p>

			<h3>COOKING 👩🏻‍🍳</h3>
				<p>	I am very passionate about cooking. I love the ability to create from scratch. Sometimes I go into a cooking situation without knowing exactly what to do and it just comes to me in a fit of inspiration. And when at the end you have conjured up a delicious dish that friends or family will enjoy, you are proud of yourself in the end.</p>

		<div class="card-white">
			<h3>FASHION 👠</h3>
				<p>For me, fashion means living out your creativity. There is personality behind it and you can try out new clothes. You also feel good when you have a nice outfit on and are therefore more self-confident.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="card-white">
			<h3>MY DOG 🐶</h3>
				<p>I have a big dog named Ari. He's almost 5 years old and very lovely. I love taking long walks with him. He's like my best friend and since he belonged to my grandpa, he reminds me of him every day.</p>
